Name: Samar Hussein


- once the zip folder is downloaded unzip and in the terminal run npm install and all the node modules should install
- then run the daemon with the database to be store in the data folder
- then run database-initializer.js
- then run node server.js
- and go to the url


- the folder has 10 pug files and 4 client.js files
- register.js is to handle the post of the new user
- login.js is to handle the login
- logout.js is to handle the logout
- orderform.js to handle the order


* I have changed the database initializer so the ten users can have order to begin with.



- Credit is given to  the author/s Dave Mckenney of the file orderform.js and the orderform.html which has been changed to a pug file
